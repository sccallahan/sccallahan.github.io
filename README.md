## About
Hi everyone, I'm Carson. I'm a graduate of the [MSTP - UT Houston](https://gsbs.uth.edu/mdphd/) MD/PhD program, a joint effort between the University of Texas McGovern Medical School and MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences! My PhD research was conducted in the labs of [Jeffrey N. Myers](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jeffrey_myers.html) and [Kunal Rai](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/rai-laboratory.html) and focused on the (epi)genomic regulation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

I'm currently a PGY3 Radiation Oncology resident at [University of Wisconsin Department of Human Oncology](https://www.humonc.wisc.edu/).
